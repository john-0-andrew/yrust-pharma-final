          <h2>Preserving Local History</h2>

          <p>
            In 2018, technology companies, Desktop Doctors & Digital Upgrade
            found a new place to call home, at 816 N. 9th Ave. Since the
            takeover of the 118-year-old building (formally Stippler Tool &
            Supply and Crown Chair Company), there have been many renovations
            completed to preserve this local piece of Evansville, IN history.
